    "\n",
    "A very useful way to visualise event-based star data is to accumulate all the events in the file together to generate a single frame that captures all the data within the file. This is a very similar method that we used in the previous tutorial to render frames, except that we count the number of events at each pixel instead of just marking whether an event occurred or not. We also apply it across the whole recording. \n",
    "\n",
    "This technique works particularly well on star data as it is inherently a sparse dataset. If you were to do the same to the recordings in the previous tutorial, the results would be very hard to interpret.
