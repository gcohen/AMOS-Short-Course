# AMOS 2023: An Introduction to Event-based Sensors for SDA: A Hands-On Tutorial

This repository contains the materials for the AMOS 2023 short course on event-based sensors. The course contains three tutorials, which cover the basics of working with event-based data, techniques for working with neuromorphic star data, and the use of event-warping and astrometry to find star map solutions. 

These tutorials can now be run on Google Colab, allowing you to run them entirely from within your browser. You can access the tutorials from the links below:

- [Tutorial 1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gcohen/AMOS-Short-Course/blob/main/Tutorial1.ipynb)
- [Tutorial 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gcohen/AMOS-Short-Course/blob/main/Tutorial2.ipynb)
- [Tutorial 3](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gcohen/AMOS-Short-Course/blob/main/Tutorial3.ipynb)

You can also clone this repository and run the tutorials locally. Tutorial 1 includes set-up instructions to assist you in installing all the required packages. The third tutorial requires some additional packages to run, and includes a section at the top of the tutorial to assist you in installing the required packages.

Additional course materials (presentation slides and tutorials) please access our course [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ma_1E69K_QsEAnkZ1QZdZq7U1hjK08c-?usp=sharing).

### Live Demonstration

For those of you interested in participating in the live demonstration and challenge task for the course, we have built a library containing a number of tools called [Octans](https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/octans). 

Good luck!
